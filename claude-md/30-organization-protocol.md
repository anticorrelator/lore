## Organization Protocol

Captures are filed automatically by `lore capture` — no manual inbox-to-category step is needed.

`/memory curate` is available for periodic refinement: deduplication, backlink maintenance, dropping entries that no longer meet the capture gate, and title quality improvements.

**When to suggest curate:**
- After a session with >5 captures — briefly mention curation is available
- When you notice duplicates or stale entries during normal work
- Never run curate automatically — it is always the user's choice to invoke
